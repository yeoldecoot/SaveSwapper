# SaveSwapper
A simple game manager for if you have multiple instances of a game (i.e. modded and vanilla) but both share the same save location

# Installation
1: Download the latest release\n
2: Extract it somewhere\n
3: Create a shortcut for each instance of your game and place them in the shortcuts folder\n
4: Move all of your profile backups into the profile folder\n
5: launch the SaveSwapper.py file\n
6: you will be prompted to enter the path to the profile that is actually loaded by the game (for x3 this is C:\Users\xxxxx\Documents\Egosoft\X3AP)\n
7: from then on there will be a new file (Data.json) where you launched SaveSwapper.py. currently the only way to refresh your profiles and shortcuts is to delete that file\n

# Future Plans
I would like to implement a GUI for the save swapper to make it look better. I've also toyed with the idea of wrapping it in an exe somehow so people can add the manager as a non-steam game to their steam library. A proper refresh button would also be included in this GUI.
